- Use clear and recognizable icons to represent various data points (e.g., trophy icon for wins, graph icon for statistics), enhancing the user's understanding of the data.
- Implement a card-based layout for player profiles and match history to organize content into easily digestible chunks. Keep card shadows minimal.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when sorting tables or loading new data, enhancing the UX without being distracting.
